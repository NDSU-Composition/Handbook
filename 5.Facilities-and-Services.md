# 5. Facilities and Services

## 5.1 Building Use Policies

The Reineke Fine Arts Center is intended primarily for the use of NDSU students, faculty and staff. Use by others is only by permission of the Division of Performing Arts. Facilities may not be used by students for teaching private music lessons. Facilities may not be used for non-NDSU ensemble rehearsals, unless explicitly approved by the Division of Performing Arts. (Contact the Director of the NDSU Music Academy if you would like to develop a private studio as a part of the Academy.)

## 5.2 Bulletin Boards and Student Announcements

The bulletin boards adjacent to the Choir and Band Rehearsal Rooms are reserved for ensemble or area announcements and School of Music or faculty messages to students. Other bulletin boards in the building are designated for special purposes or special organizations. The student bulletin board is located in the student lounge. A general announcement board is located by the East entry to the Minard Hall Annex.

## 5.3 Student Email

Email is the official form of communication in the Challey School of Music. NDSU students automatically have an NDSU email address, and are expected to check email regularly—at least once a day. The link to set up a student e-mail account: https://kb.ndsu.edu/page.php?id=99739 

Studio communication will be through the NDSU-COMPOSERS listserv. 

## 5.4 Practice Rooms

Specific policies related to accessing locked practice rooms are outlined below:
•	Practice rooms are primarily for the use of enrolled music majors. Others may apply in the music office (Room 115) for permission to use practice rooms but must relinquish them if needed by an enrolled music major.
•	All practice rooms with grand pianos are locked and have limited access.
•	Practice rooms are available on a first come/first served basis.
•	No sign-ups are required for practice times, but students are encouraged to sign up for regular practice times. Sign-up cards are outside each practice room.
•	Piano majors will have access to the practice rooms with grand pianos. Piano majors should obtain a key for the grand piano practice rooms from the Administrative Assistant (Reineke 115) and will pay a $20 key deposit (refundable on return).
•	Practice rooms are not to be used for teaching private students
•	Practice rooms are not to be locked. Do not leave your personal belongings in a practice room
It is incumbent upon everyone to respect the practice rooms and the instruments and equipment therein. Please do not place personal items such as backpacks or books on the pianos. No food or drink is allowed in the practice rooms.
