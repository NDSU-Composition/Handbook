# 4 Studio Policies and Procedures

## 4.1 Advisors and Advising

A faculty advisor is assigned to each music major. In the case of composition majors, the composer in residence will serve as advisor. The advisor provides guidance in selecting courses and programs, assists with issues related to music studies, and refers the student to the appropriate person, department, or service for special issues. The music office evaluates the transcripts of transfer music students and assigns an appropriate advisor. Students should consult the NDSU Undergraduate Catalog and other publications as appropriate, and students are ultimately responsible for meeting graduation requirements. Curriculum worksheets are on the NDSU Registrar’s website and are updated regularly.

## 4.2 Practice and Study Commitment

Music study is demanding and rigorous in time and energy commitment. Students must commit to organized practice and writing schedules in order to improve musicianship and technical skills, to expand their portfolio, and to reach expectations of degree programs. The expectations for weekly practice hours are delineated in individual studio syllabi. If it is necessary to hold outside employment, the student must expect to extend the degree program beyond four years. Careful discussion with your advisor in this matter is recommended.

## 4.3 Performance Requirements

Composition majors have four performance requirements to complete: Performance Lessons, Major Ensembles, Minor Ensembles, and Piano Proficiency.

### 4.3.1 Performance Lessons and Studio Classes

Composition students take six credits of Applied Music/Performance Lessons on an instrument or voice.

As composition majors belong to both a performance studio and a composition studio, during semesters where composers take performance lessons they are expected to attend their performance instructor’s weekly studio class in addition to the weekly Composer’s Forum.

Each performance studio faculty member schedules required studio class meetings as an integral part of applied study. These classes permit a group study approach to common performance issues, offer informal performance opportunities, and provide exposure to repertoire. These classes are generally scheduled each Wednesday at 2 p.m., or occasionally as arranged by your instructor. The studio classes are required for all music majors studying an applied instrument or voice.

### 4.3.2 Major and Minor Ensembles

Performance ensembles are open to all students, including non-music majors. Auditions are held at the beginning of Fall semester for placement in those ensembles requiring auditions, and some ensembles may re-audition before the beginning of Spring semester. Audition notices will be posted on the bulletin boards outside the Instrumental and Choral Rehearsal Rooms (Reineke 118/122) indicating the time and place of the auditions. The director of the ensemble can provide more specific information concerning audition procedures.

Composition majors are required to complete a minimum of six semesters of Major Ensembles, and four semesters of Minor Ensembles. 

The following instrumental ensembles fulfill the credit requirements for instrumental degree tracks:  
Major Ensembles  
•	Concert Choir  
•	Madrigal Singers  
•	University Chamber Singers  
•	Wind Symphony  
•	Marching Band  
•	University Band  
•	NDSU Opera  
Minor Ensembles  
•	Cantemus  
•	Statesmen  
•	Chamber Ensembles (Mixed, Brass, Percussion, Woodwind, etc.)  
•	University Symphony Orchestra  
•	Jazz Ensemble  
•	Jazz Combo  

Failure to participate in ensembles as directed by your advisor may result in the adjustment of music scholarships (if applicable). Exceptions to the above policies (such as substituting ensembles) will be considered and approved by your advisor and the performance area 

### 4.3.3 Piano Proficiency

The composition degree requires students to pass the piano proficiency examination, preceded by up to four semesters of study in piano classes (MUSC 160, 161, 260, and 261). Placement examinations for incoming students may be administered at the beginning of each semester. Depending on the result of placement examinations, students may pass out of a portion of piano class or be placed in applied lessons instead. For students with established piano skills, up to two semesters of private study may be recommended instead of piano classes.

The Piano Proficiency Examination is administered during final examination week each semester. Students should plan to complete various parts of the examination throughout their enrollment in piano class and/or lessons; in other words, as soon as possible. Composition majors will not be permitted to sign up for academic capstone until they have successfully passed all parts of the piano proficiency examination.

## 4.4 Composition Lessons

### 4.4.1 Course Descriptions

Composition lessons are offered in a seven-semester sequence (typically starting the spring semester of the freshman year). Beginning sophomore year, composition lessons are paired with supplementary applied study (MUSC 273, 373, or 473) and result in hour-long lessons.

MUSC 166: Applied Composition. 1 credit.  
Introductory individual lessons in composition focusing on mastering simple compositional techniques in both melody and harmony.  
Prereq: MUSC 132 (Ear Training and Sight Singing I) or instructor permission.

MUSC 266: Applied Composition. 1 credit.  
Individual lessons in composition for a variety of musical media. May be repeated.  
Prereq: MUSC 166 (Applied Composition) or instructor permission.

MUSC 366: Applied Composition. 1 credit.  
Individual lessons in composition for a variety of musical media. May be repeated.  
Prereq: MUSC 231 (Music Theory IV).

MUSC 466: Applied Composition. 1 credit.  
Individual lessons in composition for a variety of musical media. May be repeated.  
Prereq: MUSC 366 (Applied Composition).

### 4.4.2 Registration

Students are free to sign up for composition lessons without instructor permission, provided prerequisites are met. 

Students must register for composition lessons before the end of the first day of classes each semester to be guaranteed a studio space; placement after that time is contingent upon instructor availability and approval.

### 4.4.3 Course Challenges

Through the course of study, students may challenge into a higher composition course through the following protocol:
1. Students may only successfully challenge a course once. 
2. Current students who wish to challenge a course must do so while enrolled in a composition course. If successful, the course challenge will apply to the next 16-week semester.
3. Students shall submit a portfolio of three to five scores and recordings to the composition faculty for evaluation. One of the scores must have a performance history and live recording.
4. The composition faculty will approve or reject the challenge prior to the beginning of a 16-week semester.

## 4.5 Concert Attendance

Students taking composition lessons are required to attend all scheduled convocations during the semester they are enrolled, and twenty events of their choosing. Events which count towards a performance lesson attendance requirement may also count towards composition lesson requirements. Students are encouraged to attend a variety of events.

## 4.6 Grading

Composition lessons are difficult to grade because student output does not always accurately represent student work. For example, you may spend your week pursuing a new melody or compositional tool, only to discover that it doesn’t work for your project.

For that reason, all composition lesson grades receive full credit (with the exception of F) but letter-grade feedback evaluates the week's progress. 

A: The Zone  
The amount of work submitted exceeds expectations.  
Receives: 100% of points.

B: The Grind  
The amount of work submitted is as expected. (This is the default grade).  
Receives: 100% of points.

C: The Tough Week  
The amount of work submitted is below average.  
Receives: 100% of points.  
Fifth C in a row becomes a D.

D: The Disappointment  
No work was submitted for the lesson  
Receives: 100% of points  
Third D in a row becomes a F.

F: The No-Show  
The lesson was abandoned.  
Receives: 0% of points.  
Third F in a semester results in a one-semester suspension from composition lessons.

## 4.7 Composition Levels

To facilitate composition instruction, composition students are evaluated semesterly as part of the composition jury/final portfolio submission process. 

Level 1: Noise Novice  
This level is representative of the beginning composer.  
•	Student has no significant works

## 4.8 Composition Portfolio

All composition students are to keep a composition portfolio that includes completed works, recordings, documentation of performances, reviews, and a list of works and performances. By the end of composition study at NDSU, the composition portfolio should include at least five substantial works that reflect a variety of media, forms, and techniques, including at least one of each of the following:  
1.	solo work
2.	work for voice(s), with or without accompaniment
3.	work for chamber ensemble (five+ performers)
4.	work that demonstrates facility with larger forms (e.g., a multi-movement work)
5.	electroacoustic, computer, and/or intermedia work  
Additionally, the portfolio must demonstrate proficiency composing for all instrumental families (woodwinds, brass, strings, piano, and percussion). Students are encouraged to find performance opportunities for all works included in the portfolio prior to graduation.

## 4.9 Juries

All composition majors are evaluated on a regular basis. These evaluations include the Undergraduate Composition Juries, Sophomore Composition Barrier Jury, Senior Composition Recital Hearing, and the Final Portfolio Review. These evaluations are scheduled at regular times throughout the academic year:  
Second week of classes each semester: Senior Composition Recital Hearings, Undergraduate Composition Juries (make-up or follow-up from previous semester.)  
Finals week each semester: Undergraduate Composition Juries.  
Finals week of the Spring semester: Sophomore Composition Barrier Juries.  
During each evaluation, students will be assessed to determine their current compositional level.

Undergraduate Composition Juries occur at the end of each semester and consist of a meeting of the student composer and an examination panel consisting of a mix of music faculty and lay listeners. Students should submit digital copies of their work for the semester (in PDF form) via the studio website and should be prepared to play recordings of musical works (either recordings of live performances or computer-realized versions). Students will be evaluated on the portfolio of works they completed during the semester.

The Sophomore Composition Barrier Jury is required for students intending to major in composition. Composition majors must pass the Sophomore Composition Barrier Jury before continuing in MUSC 366. Students who have completed MUSC 266 but do not intend to major in composition are not required to take this jury. During this jury, the student will be evaluated based on the following areas:  
1.	Quality and presentation of the entire portfolio including such issues as musical content, notational accuracy, and neatness of manuscript will be considered.
2.	Academic standing (including GPA and concentration status).
3.	Overall productivity and participation in Challey School of Music activities.
4.	Progress toward the Music Major curriculum, especially regarding Theory, Ear Training, and Class Piano.
5.	Understanding of contemporary musical concepts and knowledge of contemporary repertoire.
6.	Elevation to Composition Level 3 or higher.  
Students should submit digital copies of their portfolio (in PDF form) via the studio website and should be prepared to play recordings of musical works (either recordings of live performances or computer-realized versions). 

Senior Composition Recital Hearings take place during the second week of classes and will be considered after the student has taken 9 hours of composition lessons and has been elevated to Composition Level 5. Students should notify the composer in residence of their intent to schedule a Senior Composition Recital Hearing.

Once a Senior Composition Recital Hearing is scheduled, the student will submit the proposed senior recital program memo via the studio website. The proposed program memo should include the title, complete instrumentation, year of composition, and duration for each work. The senior recital program should adequately demonstrate the diversity of the student's composition portfolio.

No later than the Monday prior to the scheduled hearing, each eligible student will submit a portfolio for review by the faculty. The portfolio materials must be uploaded to the studio website. These materials include:  
1.	Scores (one copy each) of each work included on the program.
2.	Recordings of each work included on the program. Recordings may include reading sessions, live performances, edited studio mixes of the selected compositions, or if all other options have been exhausted, computer realizations.
3.	A complete set of performance-ready parts for all works to be presented on the recital.
		
Following the hearing, the composition faculty will make its recommendation concerning the student’s Senior Composition Recital. 

## 4.10 Composition Performance Requirements

Students are expected to achieve a level of proficiency on an instrument equivalent to pass the Sophomore Instrumental/Vocal Barrier Jury as expected for BA/BS students.

## 4.11 Recital/Capstone

Students who have passed the Senior Composition Recital Hearing may proceed with scheduling the event in consultation with the composer in residence. The student will organize a senior composition recital review committee consisting of the composition instructor and two other music faculty members. 

Once the student and the senior recital review committee determine a mutually acceptable recital date (no later than six weeks prior to the event), the recital may be confirmed with the Concert Facilities Manager (Maggie Latterell).

Any special arrangements (e.g., audio/video playback, theatrical lighting, staging) must be made at least four weeks prior to the event. 

A note regarding hall scheduling and equipment needs: Our concert facilities staff often have impossible demands and schedules that they make look easy. It is our intention as a studio to be their favorite studio to work with. Difficulties that arise in their job due to gross negligence of the recitalist may result in cancellation of the composition recital at the discretion of the composer in residence.

The student will submit a complete and accurate program to the composer in residence, and then to the promotions director at least one month prior to the event. This program will include composition titles, movement titles (if any), composition dates, and the names of all assisting performers. If the personnel or repertoire changes between the time the program is submitted and the event, students are responsible for printing program corrections. All changes from the submitted program must be approved by the composer in residence.

Program notes are required for the portfolio, although the student may opt not to distribute them at the recital; these must be submitted to the composition instructor for approval at least one week prior to the event. Program note printing is handled by the studio rather than the promotions director.

Flyers, posters, or any other advertising for the event must be approved by the composer in residence. It is recommended that these materials be posted no later than one week prior to the event. The promotions director may have resources available to distribute posters.

Advertising materials should include the following information:  
1.	day, date, year, and time of event.
2.	location of the event: include building, hall name, and room number.
3.	Challey School of Music logo

Following the senior recital, each committee member will complete a Senior Composition Recital Evaluation which is forwarded to the composer in residence. The student will be informed of the committee's decision usually within one week of the recital.
