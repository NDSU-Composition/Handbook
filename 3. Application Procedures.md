# 3. Application Procedures

Admission into any music degree is not automatic. Students who major in music have generally had considerable performance experience with instrumental/vocal ensembles or as soloists. Entering students must be able to understand music notation and in most cases must read music with some fluency. Admission is based on demonstrated accomplishment in basic musicianship, notation familiarity, work ethic, performance ability, and performance potential. Students may have to complete prerequisite work or courses either prior to or after admission to a degree program.

## 3.1 Preparation for the composition major

Preparation for study as a composition major is somewhat different than preparation for study as a performance, education, or general music major. While incoming students are expected to have a familiarity in performance and fluency in reading music notation, incoming students generally have little to no formal training in music composition. This is an obstacle, but not an insurmountable one. Before joining the composition studio as a composition major, students should have reasonably audiation skills (provided in Ear Training and Sight Singing I) and working familiarity in a notation program of their choice. 

## 3.2 Entrance Requirements

Applying for any music degree at NDSU is a multiple-stage process: Students must apply to the University, the School of Music, and to the Program.

Students who want to pursue composition lessons as enrichment (that is, not as a major) may do so if allowed by the instructor and if they have completed the prerequisites. 

Students wishing to pursue composition as a major must complete a performance audition for acceptance into the Challey School of Music before their first semester as a music major. The application procedure is common to all incoming students and is as follows:
Step 1: Apply for Admission to NDSU
Step 2: Schedule a visit to meet with the Challey School of Music faculty (including the composer in residence).
Step 3: Audition for admission into the Challey School of Music.
Up-to-date information on completing these steps is available at https://ndsu.edu/music 

You must audition for admission into the Challey School of Music prior to the start of your first semester of music major classes. Contact the applied teacher of your instrument/voice to schedule an audition.

Note: All composition students have a performance requirement as part of their degree plan and apply for admission on the basis of their performance ability. For more information on audition requirements, consult the NDSU Music website.

## 3.3 Application and Acceptance into the Composition program

Students may apply to the composition program by submitting a portfolio of original works to the composer in residence. The portfolio should consist of scores to three to five of the composerâ€™s best scores and recordings (if available). Scores should be properly notated in a standard notation program. 

Scores should be submitted in hard copy or by PDF.

## 3.4 Scholarship Obligations

Many of our students receive scholarship-based financial assistance. These scholarships recognize musical talent, dedication to the requirements and recommendations of your program of study, and service to the School of Music.

Scholarship payments will happen in two equal portions, at the beginning of fall and spring semesters, and are applied toward your tuition automatically.

As stated in your scholarship letter, you are required to maintain a grade point average of 2.5 or above overall and 3.0 or above in your music courses. In addition to your grades, your scholarship letter contains obligations to make adequate academic progress, perform and participate in appropriate music ensembles, and to be a productive member of your applied studio.

Scholarship awards are reviewed each semester by your advisor and the music faculty. The amount of scholarship support may be adjusted after this review because of your overall performance (including considerations such as academic achievement, musical progress, commitment to the program, service, and participation in required and recommended activities). Please remember that being a scholarship student is an honor and makes you a leader in the Challey School of Music.

### 3.4.1 Returning Student Scholarships 

Applications are due each spring, typically near the end of February, and auditions for special performance scholarships (if applicable) are generally held by mid-March. Application forms are available online at the following link: https://www.ndsu.edu/onestop/finaid/scholarships/. 

The Theodore Presser Award requires a separate application form. This award is available to music majors who have achieved senior standing.
