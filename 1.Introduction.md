# 1. Introduction

This handbook is intended to supplement academic policies and student handbooks at NDSU. If any provision in this handbook conflicts with an established academic policy, the university or departmental policy will prevail (though other parts of this handbook that are not in conflict will stay in effect).

This handbook is designed to provide information and context concerning some of the policies, guidelines, and procedures of NDSU Music Composition. It is your responsibility to be aware of these policies, guidelines, and procedures. Music faculty and staff are available to answer questions and assist you. Other, more general information about NDSU is available in the current NDSU Undergraduate Catalog located at https://catalog.ndsu.edu.

Challey School of Music announcements concerning academic updates, application deadlines, performance calendars and other timely subjects are posted in the Reineke Fine Arts Center, on the NDSU School of Music webpage, and/or distributed through email to your official NDSU email account. The university considers your email account to be the official channel for communication, and you should check it frequently. Additional channels of communication for NDSU Music Composition are discussed later.
